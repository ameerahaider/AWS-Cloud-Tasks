## Task 1: AWS EC2 WordPress Deployment with Terraform
Provisioned an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform, installed WordPress, set up a MySQL database on the instance, and configured WordPress to use that MySQL database. This setup utilized a user data script for automation.

## Task 2: NGINX Research
Researched on Nginx, it features and documented it.

## Task 3: NGINX Load Balancer Setup on AWS EC2 on Console

Set up an NGINX load balancer on an EC2 instance to distribute traffic to two backend EC2 instances, explained and added screenshots of the steps.

## Task 4: ECS Fargate Nginx Server Deployment with Terraform
Set up an Nginx server running on Amazon ECS Fargate using Terraform. Created a VPC, security group, ECS cluster, and ECS service with minimal configurations.

## Task 5: ECS Fargate Nginx Server Deployment with ALB and EFS using Terraform
Set up a highly available and scalable infrastructure on Amazon ECS Fargate using Terraform. The setup includes a VPC, security groups, ECS cluster, ECS service with a custom Docker image, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and an Elastic File System (EFS) for persistent storage.

## Task 6: ECS EC2 with EFS using Terraform
Sets up an ECS cluster with EC2 instances to run an Nginx server, including an Application Load Balancer (ALB), Elastic File System (EFS) for persistent storage, and monitoring using CloudWatch Logs. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform.

## Task 7: Deploying an Application on ECS EC2 using AWS CodePipeline manually 
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up AWS CodePipeline on AWS console, for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of your application which is already up and running on ECS. 

## Task 8: Deploying an Application using AWS CodePipeline on ECS EC2 using Terraform
This project sets up an ECS cluster with EC2 instances to run an application and then sets up AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). The infrastructure is managed using Terraform.

## Task 9: Deploying a Simple Node.js Application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk
This guide will walk you through the process of deploying a simple Node.js application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using the AWS Management Console. Follow these steps to get your application up and running.

## Task 10: Deploying a Node.js Application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Terraform
This project automates the deployment of a Node.js application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Terraform. The deployment involves creating an S3 bucket to store the application bundle, setting up an Elastic Beanstalk application, and configuring an Elastic Beanstalk environment.

## Task 11: Deploying a Node.js Application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with AWS Code Pipeline using Terraform
This project automates the deployment of a Node.js application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Terraform. The deployment involves creating an S3 bucket to store the artifacts, setting up an Elastic Beanstalk application, and configuring an Elastic Beanstalk environment. The project uses AWS Code Pipeline to automate the entire process.

## Task 12: Jenkins Agent Setup and ECS Deployment Pipeline
This guide explains how to set up a Jenkins agent on an AWS EC2 instance, configure AWS CLI with SSO, create the necessary AWS infrastructure, and set up a Jenkins pipeline that deploys a Dockerized application from GitHub to AWS ECS. It also includes instructions on how to trigger the Jenkins pipeline.

## Task 13: Jenkins Agent Setup and ECS Deployment Pipeline using Terraform
This guide explains how to set up a Jenkins agent on an AWS EC2 instance, configure AWS CLI with SSO, create the necessary AWS infrastructure, and set up a Jenkins pipeline that deploys a Dockerized application from GitHub to AWS ECS. It also includes instructions on how to trigger the Jenkins pipeline. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform.

## Task 14: Deploying a NodeJS App on EC2 Instance Using Terraform and Scripted Jenkins Pipeline
This guide provides detailed instructions on setting up a Jenkins agent on an AWS EC2 instance, configuring AWS CLI with SSO, creating necessary AWS infrastructure using Terraform, and setting up a Jenkins pipeline to deploy a Dockerized application from GitHub to AWS EC2. Additionally, it covers how to trigger the Jenkins pipeline.

## Task 15: Terraform Workspaces
Explanation of Terraform workspaces.

## Task 16: Deploying a Simple Application on AWS EKS
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying a simple Nginx application on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). It includes setting up the EKS cluster, configuring `kubectl`, and deploying the application manually. Follow these steps to complete the deployment.
